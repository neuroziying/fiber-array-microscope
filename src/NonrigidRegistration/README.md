# Bi's lab/ Non-rigid Fiber Registration Pipeline
This repository contains a pipeline for fiber channel registration and signal extraction
under non-rigid motion conditions.

## Pipeline Overview

1. Fiber localization  
   Robust fiber center detection using a std-based temporal analysis method.

2. Registration initialization  
   Interactive parameter tuning to obtain reliable initial guesses.

3. Registration and signal extraction  
   Non-rigid registration followed by per-channel fluorescence signal extraction.
